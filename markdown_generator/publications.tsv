"SEAM: A Synergetic Energy‑Efficient Approximate Multiplier for Application Demanding Substantial Computational Resources." <i>Integration, the VLSI journal</i>, 2025.	seam-energy-multiplier	http://yw-ray.github.io/files/paper/2025-01-09-Integration.pdf	manuscripts	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167926024002013	Approximate computing constitutes a paradigm in which accuracy is exchanged for enhanced energy efficiency when contrasted with conventional computing methodologies. This approach has been devised to address the escalating demand stemming from the rapid expansion of application systems. This paper proposes an approximate multiplier for systems with heavy computational load. By amalgamating the attributes of a Dynamic range unbiased multiplier (DRUM) with an Approximate wallace tree multiplier (AWTM), we have devised a Synergetic energy-efficient approximate multiplier (SEAM) aimed at mitigating the occurrence of worst-case errors inherent in AWTM. The SEAM was analyzed for circuit area and power consumption using Design Compiler with Synopsys GPDK 32 nm. Experimental results demonstrated that SEAM achieved up to 80.46% reduction in circuit area and 82.6% reduction in power consumption compared to a precise multiplier. Furthermore, compared to DRUM, SEAM showed a 15.55% reduction in circuit area and 45.73% reduction in power consumption. In order to validate the feasibility of the proposed approximate multiplier, the circuit was implemented on a Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and applied to a fuzzy logic-based pathfinding algorithm and a Convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerator. For the pathfinding algorithm, most error metrics of the SEAM showed similar values to the DRUM. Moreover, when applied to the CNN accelerator and experimented with the CIFAR-10 dataset and MNIST dataset, the proposed multiplier exhibited identical precision, recall, and F1 score values. Despite applying SEAM, we achieved a maximum 3.1% increase in classification metrics for a specific case. These results indicate the significant potential of the SEAM in reducing the area of overall system while minimizing errors.

"Lightweight and Error‑Tolerant Stereo Matching with a Stochastic Computing Processor." <i>Electronics</i>, 2024.	stereo-matching-stochastic	http://yw-ray.github.io/files/paper/2024-05-22-Electronics.pdf	manuscripts	https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/11/2024	Stereo matching, utilized in diverse fields, poses a challenge to systems in resource-constrained environments due to the significant growth of computational load with image resolution. The challenge is crucial for the systems because fields utilizing stereo matching require short operational time for real-time applications and low power architecture. Stochastic computing (SC) is able to be a valuable approach to address the challenge by reducing the computational load by representing binary numbers with stochastic sequences, which are encoded as a probability value, and by leveraging the concept of mathematical probability. Also, it is possible for a system to be error-tolerant by utilizing the characteristics of stochastic computing. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an approach for lightweight and error-tolerant stereo matching with a hardware-implemented stochastic computing processor. To verify the feasibility and error tolerance of the proposed system, we implemented the proposed system and conducted experiments comparing depth maps with or without stochastic computing by calculating similarities. According to the experimental results, the proposed system indicated no significant differences in output depth maps and achieved an improvement in the depth maps from error-injected input images by an average of 58.95%. Therefore, we demonstrated that stereo matching with stochastic computing is feasible and error-tolerant.

"Accelerating Strawberry Ripeness Classification Using a Convolution‑Based Feature Extractor along with an Edge AI Processor." <i>Electronics</i>, 2024.	strawberry-classification	http://yw-ray.github.io/files/paper/2024-01-13-Electronics.pdf	manuscripts	https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/2/344	Image analysis-based artificial intelligence (AI) models leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNN) take a significant role in evaluating the ripeness of strawberry, contributing to the maximization of productivity. However, the convolution, which constitutes the majority of the CNN models, imposes significant computational burdens. Additionally, the dense operations in the fully connected (FC) layer necessitate a vast number of parameters and entail extensive external memory access. Therefore, reducing the computational burden of convolution operations and alleviating memory overhead is essential in embedded environment. In this paper, we propose a strawberry ripeness classification system utilizing a convolution-based feature extractor (CoFEx) for accelerating convolution operations and an edge AI processor, Intellino, for replacing FC layer operations. We accelerated feature map extraction utilizing the CoFEx constructed with systolic array (SA) and alleviated the computational burden and memory overhead associated with the FC layer operations by replacing them with the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The CoFEx and the Intellino both were designed with Verilog HDL and implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The proposed system achieved a high precision of 93.4%, recall of 93.3%, and F1 score of 0.933. Therefore, we demonstrated a feasibility of the strawberry ripeness classification system operating in an embedded environment.

Accordingly, the efficient implementation and management of monitoring systems tailored for elderly people living alone have become paramount. Monitoring systems are generally implemented based on multiple sensors, and the collected data are processed on a server to provide monitoring services to users. Due to the use of multiple sensors and a reliance on servers, there are limitations to economical maintenance and a risk of highly personal information being leaked. In this paper, we propose an intelligent monitoring system with privacy preservation based on edge AI. The proposed system achieves cost competitiveness and ensures high security by blocking communication between the camera module and the server with an edge AI module. Additionally, applying edge computing technology allows for the efficient processing of data traffic. The edge AI module was designed with Verilog HDL and was implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Through experiments conducted on 6144 frames, we achieved 95.34% accuracy. Synthesis results in a 180 nm CMOS technology indicated a gate count of 1516 K and a power consumption of 344.44 mW.

"Parallel Stochastic Computing Architecture for Computationally Intensive Applications." <i>Electronics</i>, 2023.	parallel-stochastic-architecture	http://yw-ray.github.io/files/paper/2023-04-06-Electronics.pdf	manuscripts	https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/7/1749	Stochastic computing requires random number generators to generate stochastic sequences that represent probability values. In the case of an 8-bit operation, a 256-bit length of a stochastic sequence is required, which results in latency issues. In this paper, a stochastic computing architecture is proposed to address the latency issue by employing parallel linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs). The proposed architecture reduces the latency in the stochastic sequence generation process without losing accuracy. In addition, the proposed architecture achieves area efficiency by reducing 69% of flip-flops and 70.4% of LUTs compared to architecture employing shared LFSRs, and 74% of flip-flops and 58% of LUTs compared to the architecture applying multiple LFSRs with the same computational time.
2023-01-19	Photoplethysmography‑Based Distance Estimation for True Wireless Stereo	Micromachines	<b>Youngwoo Jeong</b>, Joungmin Park, Sun Beom Kwon, Seung Eun Lee. "Photoplethysmography‑Based Distance Estimation for True Wireless Stereo." <i>Micromachines</i>, 2023.	ppg-distance-estimation	http://yw-ray.github.io/files/paper/2023-01-19-Micromachines.pdf	manuscripts	https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666x/14/2/252	Recently, supplying healthcare services with wearable devices has been investigated. To realize this for true wireless stereo (TWS), which has limited resources (e.g. space, power consumption, and area), implementing multiple functions with one sensor simultaneously is required. The Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is a representative healthcare sensor that measures repeated data according to the heart rate. However, since the PPG data are biological, they are influenced by motion artifact and subject characteristics. Hence, noise reduction is needed for PPG data. In this paper, we propose the distance estimation algorithm for PPG signals of TWS. For distance estimation, we designed a waveform adjustment (WA) filter that minimizes noise while maintaining the relationship between before and after data, a lightweight deep learning model called MobileNet, and a PPG monitoring testbed. The number of criteria for distance estimation was set to three. In order to verify the proposed algorithm, we compared several metrics with other filters and AI models. The highest accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score of the proposed algorithm were 92.5%, 92.6%, 92.8%, and 0.927, respectively, when the signal length was 15. Experimental results of other algorithms showed higher metrics than the proposed algorithm in some cases, but the proposed model showed the fastest inference time.

Systems that compose the ITS adopt architectures that applied the cloud computing which consists of a highperformance general-purpose processor or graphics processing unit. However, an architecture that only used the cloud computing requires a high network bandwidth and consumes much power.
