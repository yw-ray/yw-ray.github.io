Hi, I am a Hardware Engineer at MangoBoost, a DPU startup company, where I joined the System Solution Group in March 2024.

During my master’s studies, I was advised by Professor [Seung Eun Lee](https://soc.seoultech.ac.kr/Professor/Professor.html) and was a member of the [Computer Architecture Lab](https://soc.seoultech.ac.kr/).
My research interests include Computer Architecture, Domain-Specific Accelerators, and HW/SW Co-Design.

You can find more details in my [CV](http://yw-ray.github.io/files/YoungwooJeong_CV.pdf).
