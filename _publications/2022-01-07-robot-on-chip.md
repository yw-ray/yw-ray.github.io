The interest in autonomous robots is growing due to diverse usability. Autonomous robots are equipped with various sensors for stable operation. As the sensor data increases, the system for sensor signal processing and actuators controlling is complicated. In this paper, we propose the robot-on-chip (RoC) which processes all functions for an autonomous robot on a single chip mounted on a robot. In order to realize the RoC, we designed an autonomous robot with a lightweight algorithm and a hardware-friendly architecture. We demonstrated the feasibility of the RoC that the robot moves successfully without bumping into people in a building by recognizing the environment.
