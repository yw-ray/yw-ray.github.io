In this paper, we propose an embedded fuzzy logic controller (EFLC) with a focus on addressing the challenges arising from the increasing number of fuzzy rules in autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). The Cortex-M0 is selected as the main processor, and the entire logic was implemented utilizing Verilog HDL. In order to evaluate performance, we analyzed the execution time difference between a software-only implementation of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) on Cortex-M0 and a hardware-accelerated implementation with the proposed EFLC. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed design were demonstrated through simulations and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation.
